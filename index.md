## Goals

Our aim is to make it easier for volunteers to get connected with organizations.

Create a site that allows users to:
- Register and sign into their account
- Have personal profile pages
- sign up for volunteer events
- allow users to create volunteer events

Create a site that:

- Makes the volunteering process easier
- Looks attractive and modern
- Is easy to navigate


## Installation Guide
 
 First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, visit the [Manoa Exchange application github page](https://github.com/manoa-exchange/manoa-exchange-meteor-app), and click the "Use this template" button to create your own repository initialized with a copy of this application. 

Third, cd into the Manoa Exchnage /app directory and install libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

```
$ npm install cloudinary
```

Fourth, run the system with:

```

If all goes well, the application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
